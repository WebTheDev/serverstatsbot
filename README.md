### Discord-ServerStatsBot
- My public repository for my custom server status bot for a discord server! 
- Designed and Tested on Python 3.7.3 for Linux and Windows
---
### [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) Packages Required (Install with [Pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installing/)):
- [Discord](https://pypi.org/project/discord.py/)
- [Asyncio](https://pypi.org/project/asyncio/) (If not already installed)
---
### Setup
-Place "[main.py](https://github.com/WebTheDev/serverstatsbot/blob/main/main.py)" and "[config.py](https://github.com/WebTheDev/serverstatsbot/blob/main/config.py)" into a folder (this is too allow the bot to be able to find the "[config.py](https://github.com/WebTheDev/serverstatsbot/blob/main/config.py)" file.

- Create a bot application at the [discord developer panel](https://discord.com/developers/applications) and add to your discord server.

- Allow the "Server Member Intent" under the "Privileged Gateway Intents" in the [discord developer panel](https://discord.com/developers/applications). (THIS IS VERY IMPORTANT! The bot will not work propertly without and will give incorrect server stats.)

- Place your bot token and adjust the "[config.py](https://github.com/WebTheDev/serverstatsbot/blob/main/config.py)" to your liking.

-Start the bot and watch the magic happen! (For windows right click on the main.py and click open, a cmd panel should appear. For linux, choose a starting resource that is best for your linux environment.)
